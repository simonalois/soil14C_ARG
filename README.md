**Abstract**:<p align="justify">
Volcanic tephra deposition is a major soil-forming factor in Patagonian Andean landscapes and strongly influences pedogenesis and soil profile development. 
However, the impact of deposition frequency and associated sedimentation rates on soil development and vertical carbon distribution remains insufficiently understood. 
This study aims to reconstruct the depositional history of volcanic tephra layers in Nothofagus dombeyi forests to improve understanding of soil formation processes 
along a north–south gradient in northern Patagonia (40°40’S to 42°5’S), Argentina. Soil profiles at eight sites on flat terrain at an elevation of around 1000 m asl., 
reaching a depth of 1.5 m were investigated close to the Chilean border. Profiles were sampled at 10 cm intervals using composite samples from four soil cores per depth interval. 
To establish a chronological framework and to identify periods of intense tephra deposition, in total 10 charcoal fragments were collected at horizon transitions and at several depths of 5 
Profiles and ¹⁴C dated at the University of Bern. Bulk density and pH values were determined for all depth intervals. Soil carbon fractions, including total organic carbon (TOC), 
residual organic carbon (ROC), and total inorganic carbon (TIC), were measured using a soliTOC analyzer (elementar). According to their climatic and spatial setting, profiles were 
grouped into northern and southern sites, revealing pronounced differences in depositional regimes and sedimentation rates. Northern profiles showed substantially higher sedimentation rates, 
averaging 6.5 cm per 100 years, indicating a stronger influence of recurrent tephra deposition. In contrast, southern profiles exhibited markedly lower sedimentation rates of approximately 1.1 cm per 100 years. 
Carbon stocks displayed contrasting depth patterns between the profile groups. Southern profiles exhibited a clear exponential decline in carbon stocks with depth, 
whereas northern profiles showed a more discontinuous distribution, likely reflecting repeated tephra deposition. Overall, carbon stocks were not consistently higher
in southern than in northern profiles. However, predictions from the mixed-effects model indicated higher carbon stocks in the topsoil of southern profiles, while the group of northern profiles 
showed an increase in carbon stocks with depth. The influence of the site group was primarily restricted to the top 50 cm, leading to a significant interaction between group and depth rather 
than a significant main effect of the group itself. The increase in residual organic carbon in the group of southern profiles and with depth suggests enhanced stabilization of carbon pools under 
conditions of slower sedimentation and longer [GC2.1]soil development. These results demonstrate that frequency and sedimentation rates of volcanic tephra deposition along the investigated 
Andean north–south transect influences soil profile development and carbon sequestration with depth. Frequent and strong tephra deposition promotes rapid burial and stratified profiles, 
whereas lower deposition rates favor undisturbed soil development and higher and more stable soil carbon stocks. The findings emphasize the importance of tephra deposition as a key driver of soil development 
and carbon sequestration and stabilization in Andosols of northern Patagonia.
